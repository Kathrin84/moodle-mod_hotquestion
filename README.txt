The first moodle activity for physical classroom. The idea comes from Purdue University's hotseat.

This activity can be used for posting questions or suggestions in a course.

Inside or outside classroom, students post into a Hot Question activity from any device which can access the Moodle site. Students can also vote on others' posts, so that the hottest post will be popped up to the top of the list. Teachers can comment on selected posts in the classroom, or by other means that are available in Moodle.
